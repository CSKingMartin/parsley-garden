      The Internet has grown into a vast, deep, and tangled web. Here is a place
      to rest your feet! This site is to be a zen garden; the free space on the
      board. Welcome! My name is Conner Parsley, a professional web developer
      and "gardener." and this is my collection of curated work, thoughts, and
      projects.
