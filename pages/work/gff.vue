      When Studio Rover invited me on to help build a new site for the Gray
      Family Foundation, I was asked to build the front-end and choose the
      technologies to my liking. In addition to helping Studio Rover achieve
      their design intent I architected all other front-end features like the
      API calls, redirects, and state management.

      <br />

      Sites like GFF are my favorite to build. The content and message of
      whatever I'm working on impacts my feelings about the work greatly.
