      IEM's design library featured a lot of sharp edges and angular line-art.
      This fit well with IEM's primary product: industrial electric equipment.
      My additions on the front end all looked to add movement to what otherwise
      would be a static brochure site with a lot of repeating inventory. The
      links in the footer have an underline drawn underneath them when hovered,
      instead of displaying by default.
