      IEM's design library featured a lot of sharp edges and angular line-art.
      This fit well with IEM's primary product: industrial electric equipment.
      My additions on the front end all looked to add movement to what otherwise
      would be a static brochure site with a lot of repeating inventory. The
      links in the footer have an underline drawn underneath them when hovered,
      instead of displaying by default.
      <br />The most robust version of this can be seen on the
      <a href="https://www.iemfg.com/offices/">offices page</a>, where the
      borders of the table cells are all drawn in.
