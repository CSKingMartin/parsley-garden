      SERA Architects design library had a palette of fun, contrasting colors
      that we wanted to showcase throughout. To bring the full arrangement into
      focus we added features like the color of the fullscreen navigation
      randomizing as it opens.
      <br />
      To feature their large portfolio of images most components were designed
      to be fullscreen to showcase their details and provide the scale of SERA's
      work.
